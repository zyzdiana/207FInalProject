First, run the following lines in the terminal to run the simulation

make mesh_mass_spring
./mesh_mass_spring

we will propose our recommended way of viewing our final simulations:
Once the simulations has started:
1. wait until you see the green and blue balls start to drop
2. press the <E> key to activate ball constraint on the trampoline
3. press the <S> key to move the activated ball constraint further down into the
   trampoline
4. press the <E> key again to deactivate the ball constraint. Now the trampoline have 
   some initial springing

the following steps can be done in any order and repeatedly; however, be cautious when using the speed up and slow down feature because they will incur potential breakdown of the simulation.
- toggle the <UP ARROW> or <DOWN ARROW> keys to increase or decrease the wind
- toggle the <SPACE> key to pause and resume wind

At any time during the simulation, feel free to do the following things at any time
- toggle the <O> or <L> keys to speed up or slow down the simulation
- toggle the <P> key to speed up or slow down the simulation
- press <T> key to start auto tracking and centering


Donâ€™t be bound with our recommended way of viewing, below we have provided a list of all of the features, and feel free to play with all of the features in the manner you wish.

Below is the list of all available keyboard features, one can toggle with any one of these features at any time during the simulation:

- <T> key for pausing and resuming the wind
- <Space key> for pausing and resuming the wind- <UP arrow key> for increasing the wind- <DOWN arrow key> for decreasing the wind
- <P> key for pausing and resuming the simulation- <O> for speeding up the simulation- <L> for slowing down the simulation
- <W> key for moving the constraint on the z-axis in the positive direction
- <S> key for moving the constraint on the z-axis in the negative direction
- <D> key for moving the constraint on the y-axis in the positive direction
- <A> key for moving the constraint on the y-axis in the negative direction
- <F> key for moving the constraint on the x-axis in the positive direction
- <R> key for moving the constraint on the x-axis in the negative direction
- <E> key for activating/deactivating a constraint
